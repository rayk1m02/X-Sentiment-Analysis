Using CreateML & NLP for sentiment analysis on X tweets.

Followed a module that was outdated. Many frameworks and actions were deprecated. (Eg. Swifter framework, MLDataTable use).
Learned as much of the relevant topics as I could (CoreML, CreateML, sentiment classification on @company/#keywords from Twitter, batch predictions).
